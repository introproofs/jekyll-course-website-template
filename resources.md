## LaTeX

It is encouraged, but not required, that you use LaTeX for typesetting your homework assignments. LaTex is a powerful markup language for typing up mathematics and is used in many technical fields. Appendix D of our <a href="https://infinitedescent.xyz/">textbook</a> has a nice introduction to the basic features of LaTeX. I will make homework files available in LaTex format so you can start using it right away. If this is your first time using LaTeX, I recommend that you start by using an online editor (e.g.  <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>). 

There are also offline TeX editors which you can install on your commputer:

- Tex editors: <a href="https://www.texstudio.org/">TeXstudio</a>
- <a href="https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/">Texmaker</a>
  
Here are some guides to the basic elements of LaTeX: 

- <a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols"> List of symbols </a>
- [Theorems/Proofs environments](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Theorems_and_proofs)
- <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_fonts">Math fonts</a>
- [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)

If you are interested in pushing your LaTeX skills further, the best place on the web for Q&A about LaTeX is <a href= "http://tex.stackexchange.com" target="_blank">tex.stackexchange</a>.

## Lean

The Lean theorem prover is a proof assistant developed principally by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research.

The Lean mathematical library, mathlib, is a community-driven effort to build a unified library of mathematics formalized in the Lean proof assistant. The library also contains definitions useful for programming. This project is very active, with many regular contributors and daily activity.
